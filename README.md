Features
Protocol-Agnostic Approach to ERC20/Native Rate-Limiting
Our system takes a protocol-agnostic approach, seamlessly integrating with ERC20 and Native tokens while incorporating robust rate-limiting mechanisms.

Performant Codebase
Built for efficiency, our codebase is designed to deliver optimal performance, ensuring smooth and reliable operation.

Multiple Token Support with Custom Withdrawal Rate Limits
Enjoy flexibility with support for multiple tokens, each customizable with individualized withdrawal rate limits. Tailor the system to your specific needs for diverse token management.

Real-time Tracking of Token Inflows/Outflows and Historical Liquidity Totals
Keep a comprehensive record of token movements within the protocol, maintaining a historical running total of liquidity. Stay informed about the health and activity of your protocol in real-time.

Enforced Withdrawal Limits and Periods for Enhanced Security
Mitigate risks by enforcing withdrawal limits and periods, preventing potential fund drainage. Our system acts as a safeguard against potential security breaches, enhancing the overall safety of your protocol.

Administrative Control and Flexibility
Empower contract owners with the ability to register tokens, override limits, and transfer administrative privileges. This flexibility ensures adaptability to changing circumstances and evolving protocol requirements.

Integration
Integrating our Circuit Breaker is a straightforward process with key steps to enhance safety.

Instantiate Circuit Breaker Contract
Initialize the Circuit Breaker contract with the appropriate constructor parameters to set up the foundation for enhanced safety measures.

Register Circuit Breaker Parameters for Each Token
Define and register specific parameters for the Circuit Breaker related to each token you wish to include in your protocol.

Add Protected Contracts to Circuit Breaker
Safeguard your protocol by adding the relevant protected contracts to the Circuit Breaker, ensuring that only authorized transactions proceed.

Enjoy Enhanced Safety
Once integrated, experience an elevated level of safety with our Circuit Breaker actively monitoring and regulating token movements.
